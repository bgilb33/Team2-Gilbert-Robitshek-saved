# Quest Name

Authors: Benji Gilbert, Noah Robitshek

### Summary
For this quest we will use a photocell to detect changes in light level caused by an intruder occluding overhead lights. Similarly, we use a thermistor to detect changes in room temperature (for example, caused by the physical exertion of character Ethan Hunt). Lastly, we will simulate a floor contact sensor using a pushbutton (if he touches the floor, an alarm is triggered).

In terms of alarm reporting, your solution should turn on LEDs indicating each type of fault: 
- green (all clear)
- red (temperature change)
- yellow (light change)
- blue (floor touch). 

Meanwhile, data on each input should be displayed as text on the console I/O (from the ESP32 over the serial channel to your laptop console window).
